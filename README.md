## Notes

1.  The three proposed tests are implemented in a `R` package
    `VALIDICLUST`. The current version of the package could be installed
    using the `VALIDICLUST_0.1.0.tar.gz` file. The development version
    of `VALIDICLUST` is also available on
    [Github](https://github.com/benhvt/VALIDICLUST).

2.  Simulations were performed on CURTA from the *MÃ©socentre de Calcul
    Intensif Aquitain*:
